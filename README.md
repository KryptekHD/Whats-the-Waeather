##Description 
    The purpose of this project was to create a weather app that would allow for you to enter the city name that you want along with the sate code that the city is located in and return the currents day weather along with the five day forcast that follows that day. through out thius project there were a few challenges that I faced, one of them being that order to use the open weather api took some time to create an api key that would allow me to acces the information that I needed. once I was bale to get that working the rest was pretty easy. Along with this, this is the firat project that I used bulma on and after using this i have found that bulma is a great and useful tool that will allow for easy styling with great results.
